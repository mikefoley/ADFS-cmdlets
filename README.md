# ADFS-cmdlets
 Example code of ADFS cmdlets that MS help never added
 I ran into issues with the ADFS cmdlets when trying to figure out how to use them. There were no examples!! Nothing in the ADFS PowerShell help was added around examples. So I muscled my way through enough to be able to add application groups and api sites. Hopefully this helps others get started.
